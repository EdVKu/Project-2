# Second project for PHYSICS 170N

Author:

## What is this about?

This project is, in its core, a matrix diagonalizer. I use Jordan's Diagonalization Algorithm to obtain, up to a certain
point (given by the user), the eigenvalues/eigenvectors obtained from an $N \times N$ symmetric matrix.

## Why?

Need to get all my credits and might be useful if there's a quant company out there who wants to pay me six figures to do matrix diagonalization for them.

## How good is it?

It gets the job done, it supports complex numbers, but it has a ton of limitations. Off the top of my head:

* It's SLOW, for $N > 8$ you'll need to get comfortable with your own thoughts for like half an hour.
* It has no documentation. You might intuit how everything works. Or not. hee hee.

## Can I test it out?

Sure, hope you like it! Do make adjustments and let me know about them!

## Do you like me?
