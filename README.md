# Second project for PHYSICS 170N

Author:

* Eduardo VÃ¡zquez Kuri

## What is this about?

This project is, in its core, a matrix diagonalizer. I use Jordan's Diagonalization Algorithm to obtain, up to a certain
point (given by the user), the eigenvalues/eigenvectors obtained from an $N \times N$ symmetric matrix.

## Why?

Need to get all my credits and might be useful if there's a quant company out there who wants to pay me six figures to do
matrix diagonalization for them.
